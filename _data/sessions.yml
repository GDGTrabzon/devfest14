  description: "Hybrid mobile apps, that mix HTML5 technologies with native shells, are a great idea when it comes to deploying your app to multiple mobile operating systems. Many frameworks such as jQuery Mobile, Sencha Touch or Ionic exist to make your development easier. But performance and experience on the device is in fact far from native. In this talk, I'll share our hybrid mobile apps know-how at Startup Kitchen, which we've been developing for over two years. We'll look at performance bottlenecks, best practices, browser behavior and finally, how we develop our mobile apps using our home-grown tartJS mobile framework based on Google Closure Library."

  description: "Vaadin is Java framework for rapid development of highly interactive HTML5-based web applications in a server-side environment. It abstracts the web from your applications, allowing them to be developed in pure Java following desktop application patterns and design. Vaadin leverages the full power of GWT, a Java to Javascript compiler making it possible to develop the entire web application stack and new client-side components without leaving the Java environment. During the session attendees will get an overview of Vaadin 7.3, a closer look at the Vaadin architecture and what really happens behind the scenes of the framework. New features of Vaadin 7.4 will also be briefly discussed."

  description: "Being the guy-for-all, full-stack developer is nowadays easier than ever. And even though putting all the workload and pressure into one person is obviously not beneficial in most cases, this fact on the other hand enables us to prototype our projects and ideas much quicker and just by ourselves, but also takes repetitive work and other time consumers away from our todo list. We'll explore how state of the art on technologies like App Engine, Android, Web or iOS together with online tools like repository hosting services, online free training and cloud storage services among others, provide us with the right environment to prototype our ideas quickly, reaching MVPs through a quick iterative development process. To illustrate that process we'll build a simple cross-platform app on Android with an Api on App Engine. We'll use Python on the api side (sample code for Go will be also provided)."

So how do you transform your organization and teams from a cost center into part of your revenue-generating business? How do you get your IT teams to work at their creative best? How do you create those magic “x10” teams that people keep talking about? Over the past 13 years, Martijn Verburg (a.k.a. The Diabolical Developer) has specialized in transforming technical teams. In this session, he covers the cultural and technical habits of highly effective teams in organizations from deep-tech startups through to ponderous government departments. He unveils the truth and tells you what not to do, based on bitter first-, second-, and thirdhand experience."
